matrix completion folder: expriments on the matrix completion problem.

test1: comparison on the MovieLens-10M dataset;
test2: comparison on the MovieLens-20M dataset;
test3: comparison on the Netflix dataset.

Run test1 to produce the left figures in Figure 1;
Run test2 to produce the middle figures in Figure 1;
Run test3 to produce the right figures in Figure 1.

Run test_long to produce top two in Figure 3.



1 bit matrix completion folder: expriments on the 1 bit matrix completion problem.

test1: comparison on the MovieLens-10M dataset;
test2: comparison on the MovieLens-20M dataset;
test3: comparison on the Netflix dataset.

Run test1 to produce the left figures in Figure 2;
Run test2 to produce the middle figures in Figure 2;
Run test3 to produce the right figures in Figure 2.

Run test_long to produce bottom two in Figure 3.




Note1: Due to size limitation, we only upload MovieLens-10M and MovieLens-20M datasets to gitgub.
      So test3 will not run correctly due to the lack of dataset.

Note2：You may download MovieLens-10M and MovieLens-20M datasets separately and copy them to the data folder.
